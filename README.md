Learn git by playing around with it and not the other way around :) ! BDACC 2025-26





    The best way to learn Git is to stop binge watching tutorials
    and just start doing it.

 Steps to follow
--
- Fork the repository to their own GitHub account(if you don't have, make one!).
- Clone your version of forked repository to your local machines.
- Fix the bugs:  Make the necessary changes to fix issues in the python files in `codes/` folder (marked with `# BUG` or `# TASK`) .
- Create a new branch: Create a new branch(see the resources shared with you!) for each issue you want to fix or optimize, with a descriptive name   
(e.g., `fix-bug4-syntax_error`).
- Commit changes: Commit your changes to your branch with a descriptive commit message explaining the issue you fixed or the improvement you made.
- Push to GitHub: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Create a Pull Request (PR): Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repository, describing the issue you fixed and the changes you made.

Everything went above your head,No problem!

Just relax and follow this flow:  
`Fork → Clone → Branch → Fix → Commit → Push → PR* → Review → Merge`  


######  _*PR stands for Pull Request and not Public Relations_ :)
